# Crop bed Management Database System

#### This is a naive (but working) database project of university database lab course.
#### Cropbed data in a greenhouse like npk sensors data, temparature and management informations like admins, employee logins and edit accesses of the authority.
###  A complete CRUD web application can be said.

#### Used: PHP to connect with database. MySQL database was used. And HTML, CSS (minimal) to interact with users.

##### bye bye.
